# ScoutingApp2023
Scouting App Code for the 2023 FRC Season

## Prerequisites
### Pypi Packages
- [`Flask`](https://pypi.org/project/Flask)
- [`google-api-python-client`](https://pypi.org/project/google-api-python-client)
- [`google-auth-httplib2`](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-httplib2)
- [`google-auth-oauthlib`](https://pypi.org/project/google-auth-oauthlib)
- [`waitress`](https://pypi.org/project/waitress)

Install With
- Windows:  &emsp;`py -m pip install --upgrade Flask google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib waitress`
- Linux: &emsp;`python3 -m pip install --upgrade Flask google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib waitress`

## Setup
1. ### Pull repository
   `git pull https://github.com/cavineers/ScoutingApp2023`
2. ### Set up Google Sheets API and Credentials
   Follow (most of) this tutorial to help get everything set up: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python

   2a. Setup OAuth for your Google Cloud Project and put the generated JSON in in file `comps/comp2023/apikeys.json`

      Diagram:
      ```
      {
         "Sheets OAuth": ...
      }
      ```
      - Sheets OAuth
          - The OAuth JSON generated by Google Cloud
          - type: `dict[str, str]`

   2b. During first runtime, click the OAuth concent link printed to the console
      - If you already did so and have generated the `comps/comp2023/token.json` file, this file can be moved into other instances of the app to use the same token.
      - Note: The token will eventually expire, so the `token.json` file must be deleted and regenerated with the OAuth concent link, and any copies must be replaced with the new token.

## Run
The following commands must be ran in the repository directory.

### Quickrun
Quickly run the flask app on `0.0.0.0:8000` with
- Windows:  &emsp;`py main.py`
- Linux: &emsp;`python3 main.py`

### Specify host IP and port
Specify IP and port to host with
- Windows:  &emsp;`py -m ScoutingApp.__main host=<ip> port=<port>`
- Linux: &emsp;`python3 -m ScoutingApp.__main host=<ip> port=<port>`
